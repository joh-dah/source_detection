# Data Creation Documentation

The data creation stage is responsible for generating the synthetic and real-world datasets used for training and validation. This stage involves generating graphs, performing SI propagation on the synthetic data, and organizing the data into a format compatible with the Torch Geometric library.

## Synthetic Data Generation
The synthetic dataset is generated by following these steps:

### Graph Generation
The synthetic graph is generated using a graph generation algorithm, such as the Watts-Strogatz model or the Barabasi-Albert model. These models create graphs with specific properties, such as small-world or scale-free networks.

### Signal Propagation
The SI propagation model is applied to the generated graph. In the SI model, each node in the graph can be in one of two states: susceptible (S) or infected (I). The infection propagates through the graph based on predefined rules, simulating the spread of an infectious disease.

### Data Split
The synthetic dataset is split into training and validation sets based on a predefined ratio.

### Data Saving
The synthetic dataset, including the graphs and infection status, is saved `data/training/synthetic/raw` and `data/training/validation/raw`.

## Real-World Data Generation
The real-world dataset is processed by following these steps:

### Get Data
The datasets are obtained from popular graph repositories using the torch_geometric.datasets module. The following real-world datasets are available:

`Karate Club`: Represents a social network of friendships between members of a karate club.

`Airports`: Represents a network of airports in Europe, where nodes represent airports and edges represent flights between them.

`Wiki`: Represents a network of web pages from Wikipedia, where nodes represent web pages and edges represent hyperlinks.

`Facebook`: Represents a social network of Facebook users, where nodes represent users and edges represent friendships.

`Actor`: Represents a network of actors and actresses from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), where nodes represent actors/actresses and edges represent co-appearances in movies.

`GitHub`: Represents a collaboration network of GitHub users, where nodes represent users and edges represent collaborations on GitHub projects.
### Signal Propagation
The SI propagation model is applied to the real world graphs. In the SI model, each node in the graph can be in one of two states: susceptible (S) or infected (I). The infection propagates through the graph based on predefined rules, simulating the spread of an infectious disease.

### Data Saving
The real-world dataset, including the graphs and infection status, is saved in the respective raw directory in `data/validation`.

## Dataset Structure
The datasets, both synthetic and real-world, follow the structure expected by the Torch Geometric library. The dataset is represented by a custom class, typically named SDDataset, that extends the torch_geometric.data.Dataset class. This class provides an interface for loading and processing the graph data.

The dataset class contains the following components:

`raw_file_names`: A list of file names corresponding to the raw data files of the dataset.

`processed_file_names`: A list of file names corresponding to the processed data files of the dataset.

`process()`: A method that processes the raw data and saves the processed data. This step typically involves applying any necessary transformations to the data, such as feature engineering or normalization.

`len()`: A method that returns the length of the dataset, i.e., the number of instances in the dataset.

`get(idx)`: A method that retrieves a specific data instance from the dataset based on the given index.

`raw_paths`: A list of file paths corresponding to the raw data files.

`processed_dir`: The directory where the processed data files are saved.
